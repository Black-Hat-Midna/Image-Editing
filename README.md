# Image_Editing

crop a part of one image into that of another seamlessly (I.E without mismatching colours etc.).

links to used images:

wall = https://pxhere.com/en/photo/12724

pear = https://pxhere.com/en/photo/1159532

woodtable = https://pxhere.com/en/photo/1084304

face = https://pxhere.com/en/photo/998102

Also note in parts of the code I resize the images to make it quicker to run, however, some results I have included are bigger outputs run on bigger sized images than I have left in the code.
This will make it quicker to run in the demo.
results are in the results folder.
 
task 1 -> colour with greyscale interpolation only.

task 2a -> editing but with only greyscaled images editing between original image and cropped (i.e seamless cloning) but with the originals gradients.

task 2b -> editing with only greyscaled images but also with mixed gradients.

task 3 -> full image editing with colour.

task 4 -> texture flattening.
